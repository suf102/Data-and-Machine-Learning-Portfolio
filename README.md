# Machine Learning From Scratch.

In this repository I am looking to deepen my knowledge fo machine learning by writing machine learning alogrithems from scratch. I will in general only use numpy to write these algorithems and I will use matplotlib to vsiualise the data and progress where appropriate.

## Regression
To begin with I have written up 4 notebooks that cover linear, logistic, multiliniear and polynomial regression. 

## Decision Trees 
The next project I attempted was to write a decision tree from scratch, thus far I have created a classifier tree.
