# Machine Learning.

In this repository I am looking to deepen my knowledge fo machine learning. I will be doing this in a few different ways, the first is to rebuild common machine learning algorithms from scratch. The Second is by putting it to use taking datasets that I can find doing analysis on them, sometimes using my own code sometimes using pre made libraries.

## Regression
To begin with I have written up 4 notebooks that cover creating linear, logistic, multiliniear and polynomial regression algorithms from scratch.

## Decision Trees 
Here I put together a decision tree algorithm to classify data.

## Projects

To put the work above to use in this folder I will use the algorithms and pre made libraries to perform data analysis. Thus far I have completed 2 projects:

A mushroom classification project that classifies mushrooms into poisonous and non poisonous,

A credit card fraud detector algorithm.
